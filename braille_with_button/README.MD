**Overview**
This Arduino code is designed to display simple arithmetic equations in Braille patterns using LEDs. It allows the user to input an equation through the serial monitor, and the program will then display the Braille patterns for the equation on the LEDs. The display of each part of the equation is controlled by a button, requiring the user to press the button to proceed to the next part.

**Variables**
- `numPins`: The number of LED pins used in the circuit (set to 12 in this code).
- `ledPins`: An array containing the pin numbers of the LEDs.
- `buttonPin`: The pin number for the button input (set to A0 in this code).
- `braillePatterns`: A 2D array representing the Braille patterns for digits 0 to 9.
- `specialSymbols`: A 2D array representing the Braille pattern for the number indicator and plus sign.
- `equalsign`: A 2D array representing the Braille pattern for the equal sign.
- `operationsymbols`: A 2D array representing the Braille patterns for the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations.

**Functions**

1. `setup()`: This function runs once when the Arduino board is powered on or reset. It initializes the LED pins as outputs, sets the button pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor, and starts serial communication.

2. `resetLEDs()`: This function turns off all the LEDs by setting their corresponding pins to LOW.

3. `displayEquation(String equationString)`: This function takes an equation string as input and displays the corresponding Braille patterns on the LEDs. It first checks if the input string is valid (with a length between 6 and 10 characters and an even number of characters). Then, it iterates through the string, extracting the digits, operation symbols, and special symbols, and calls the respective functions to display their Braille patterns on the LEDs. After displaying each part of the equation, it calls the `waitForButton()` function to wait for the user to press the button before proceeding to the next part.

4. `waitForButton()`: This function waits for the user to press and release the button connected to the `buttonPin`. It continuously checks the state of the button until it is pressed and then released.

5. `printEquation(String equationString)`: This function takes an equation string as input and prints the corresponding equation in a readable format through the serial monitor.

6. `loop()`: This is the main loop function that runs repeatedly. It checks if there is any input available in the serial monitor. If there is input, it reads the string until a newline character is encountered. It then splits the input string into individual equations (separated by spaces) and calls the `displayEquation` and `printEquation` functions for each equation.

7. `countSpaces(String str)`: This function counts the number of spaces in a given string and returns the count.

8. `displayDigits(int tens, int ones)`: This function displays the Braille patterns for a two-digit number on the LEDs. The first six LEDs represent the tens digit, and the next six LEDs represent the ones digit.

9. `displaySpecialSymbol(int symbolIndex)`: This function displays the Braille pattern for the number indicator or plus sign on the first six LEDs, depending on the value of `symbolIndex`.

10. `displayoperations(int tens)`: This function displays the Braille pattern for the addition, subtraction, or multiplication operation on the first six LEDs, depending on the value of `tens`.

11. `displayequal(int equal)`: This function displays the Braille pattern for the equal sign on the LEDs.

**Usage**
1. Connect the LEDs to the appropriate pins specified in the `ledPins` array.
2. Connect a button to the `buttonPin` and ground.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
4. Open the serial monitor and enter an equation in the format `<number><operation><number>`, e.g., `0015101000`, `0029200400`, `0037300500`. Multiple equations can be entered, separated by spaces.
5. The program will display the Braille patterns for the first part of the equation on the LEDs.
6. Press the button to display the next part of the equation.
7. Repeat step 6 until the entire equation has been displayed.
8. The program will also print the equation in a readable format in the serial monitor.

Note: The code assumes a specific format for the input equations. If the input does not follow the expected format, the program will not display or print anything.
